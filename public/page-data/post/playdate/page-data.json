It reminds me so much of the original Game Boy.</p><p></p><p>One of the more interesting features of the system is that it has a crank which serves as an analog controller to assist in whatever creative game play experience desired. It might look a little gimmicky but the more I think about it the more I feel it could add a fun dimension to a lot of games.</p><p></p><p>You get the Playdate and the initial 24 games made for the system for $179 dollars. That&#39;s a pretty good deal, IMO.</p><p></p><p>There is a developer kit coming out for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Games can be written in Lua and/or C depending on performance needs of the game. </p><p></p><p>The Playdate looks like a lot of fun and I&#39;m looking forward to pre-ordering mine.</p>"},"createdAt":"2021-06-08T17:49:26.003322+00:00","date":"2021-06-08","tags":["playdate","gaming"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/q8mELPQGSESG7uLlHwQ9"}},"twitterPost":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

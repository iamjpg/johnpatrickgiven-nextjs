Regardless on the opinion around using a sleep method, it is nice to have a sleep helper method in JS.\n\nIf you're interested in having a sleep utility method, here is how you can do it:\n\n```javascript{numberLines: true}\nconst sleep = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n\nconst functionUsingSleep = async () => {\n  const result = await someFunction();\n  await sleep(500); // Wait 500 more milliseconds\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThere are couple of things to note about this implementation.\n\nFirst, notice that the method uses `async/await`. So to use the sleep method it needs to be inside an `async` function and you must `await` the sleep() method.\n\nThat's about it. A one liner and nice little utility.","createdAt":"2021-06-16T20:38:35.383511+00:00","date":"2021-06-16","tags":["javascript"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

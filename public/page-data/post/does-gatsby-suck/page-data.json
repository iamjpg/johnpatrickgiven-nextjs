It would make much more sense to compare it to <a target='_blank' title=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\" href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">11ty.dev</a> but I digress. For now, let&#39;s take the points in the thread one at a time and see if I have a similar or differing opinion.</p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294360642146306\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294360642146306\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/WRXRMi8LRN6q6CS4y08E\" alt=\"nat-tweet-2.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-2.png\" width=\"586\" height=\"170\" /><p></p><p>This isn&#39;t my experience at all. I agree that Gatsby has hitched its horse to GraphQL but as far as needing 5 plugins to access a data source? Not at all. Here&#39;s my code to hook into GraphCMS:</p><p></p><p></p><iframe\n          width=\"300\"\n          height=\"300\"\n          frameBorder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n          allowFullScreen\n          title=\"https://codepen.io/iamjpg/embed/BaWVBGe?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=js\"\n          src=\"https://codepen.io/iamjpg/embed/BaWVBGe?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=js\"\n        ></iframe><p></p><p>That&#39;s it. Not 5 plugins. One. As I would expect. It&#39;s unfortunate the thread doesn&#39;t provide a real example illustrating the authors actual struggles. The reader is just expected to take the author at their word.</p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294362378571778\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294362378571778\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/xuGLfnUsSFCHY6XY34We\" alt=\"nat-tweet-3.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-3.png\" width=\"588\" height=\"154\" /><p></p><p>I agree that Gatsby is fairly marketing driven but what framework isn&#39;t? The competition in this space is insane so of course there is an element of marketing.</p><p></p><p>Putting ecosystem and community in quotes seems disingenuous as there clearly is an active community around Gatsby. We get it. You don&#39;t like Gatsby. But if you&#39;re going to make a statement alleging they &quot;require&quot; the community to flood Github/NPM with &quot;hundreds&quot; of &quot;ill-maintained&quot; packages you should at least provide proof.</p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294363532029953\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294363532029953\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/nG5SrvE6R8i8Rkv6mO2A\" alt=\"nat-tweet-4.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-4.png\" width=\"591\" height=\"151\" /><p></p><p>I can&#39;t speak to this. I didn&#39;t use any starter outside of the initial setup script: `npm init gatsby`.</p><p></p><p>If you&#39;re relying on starters and theme packages then you chose to dive into those waters yourself. </p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294364618280965\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294364618280965\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/q33OHrgvQamGeJFwNCxT\" alt=\"nat-tweet-5.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-5.png\" width=\"591\" height=\"140\" /><p></p><p>We&#39;re just complaining to complain now. The author literally doesn&#39;t like the main thing I love about Gatsby - having a static site which is built using dynamic data.</p><p></p><p>The comparison is literally apples and oranges. Web servers do one thing incredibly well - serve static HTML, JS, CSS, and assets. Server to client communication causes server latency before passing data to the client. It will always be more efficient to just send static HTML.</p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294365713076225\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294365713076225\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/IH9AfryReScNRa4xYQy4\" alt=\"nat-tweet-6.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-6.png\" width=\"587\" height=\"114\" /><p></p><p>I&#39;m glad the author spent a whole 10 minutes wrapping their head around that one. </p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294366912643072\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294366912643072\">next tweet</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/oCeebsACTD2dEcARk9a7\" alt=\"nat-tweet-7.png\" title=\"nat-tweet-7.png\" width=\"589\" height=\"153\" /><p></p><p>This sounds like the author didn&#39;t actually read the documentation and just wanted Gatsby to be easy. If you change your schema, you need to update your fragments. Furthermore, if the schema is wrong how is that Gatsby&#39;s fault? The further I dive into this thread the more confused I get.</p><p></p><p>The <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294367961190402\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294367961190402\">next tweet</a> and the <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294369118769152\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1401294369118769152\">next one</a> in the thread:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/VOA0DjrSQiDDLXFkVDYg\" alt=\"tweet-fragment.png\" title=\"tweet-fragment.png\" width=\"588\" height=\"353\" /><p></p><p>Let&#39;s just ignore point #1 (because it&#39;s opinion) and especially #2 (because it has no place in this discussion). Points 3, 4, and 5 are literally what all companies do. Isn&#39;t this what VueJS does? Angular? React? StencilJS? Svelte?</p><p></p><p>I mean, when it comes to point #5 entire markets are build off of consulting for Frameworks. Not just Javascript but all of them. Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Drupal, Django. Again, I fail to see the point outside of the desire to hate on Gatsby.</p><p></p><p>It was weird coming across this thread the day after I built this site. I was able to complete this site start to hosted in about 3 hours which made this thread that much more of a head scratcher.</p><p></p><p>If you want client to server communication then of course use something like NextJS, ExpressJS, or literally anything else. But to shit on a framework publicly because it didn&#39;t do what you felt it should do is weird. What&#39;s worse to me is these web development threads on Twitter can be highly influential to newer developers. I&#39;d <a target='_blank' title=\"https://twitter.com/tonimaunde/status/1401304258641866756\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tonimaunde/status/1401304258641866756\">hate for a young developer to be discouraged from trying Gatsby</a> because this thread&#39;s author made a unilateral decision on the subject.</p><p></p><p>The amount of choice is what I love about the Javascript ecosystem. This site used to be a NextJS app. Now it&#39;s a Gatsby app. Before both of those it was a VueJS app. After this, I might give Svelte a try just because. No framework is perfect. None of them fit like a perfect puzzle piece. I say try them all and use the one which makes the most sense for what you&#39;re building.</p><p></p><p>To me, Gatsby is a fine framework. Is it perfect? No. Is it fun to develop in? Yes because I love React and I especially love the GraphQL integration the author above so disapproves of.</p>"},"createdAt":"2021-06-06T21:40:45.981776+00:00","date":"2021-06-06","tags":["gatsby","react","javascript"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/q8mELPQGSESG7uLlHwQ9"}},"twitterPost":""}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

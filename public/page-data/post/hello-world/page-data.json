Web servers are incredibly good at serving HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. The ability to build a static website off of dynamic data is a fun paradigm. Once deployed there&#39;s no SSR, no database calls, no server side computation - just HTML, CSS, JS, and assets served over the wire. The result is a blazing fast site right out of the box. </p><p></p><p>While this site is fairly simple the <a target='_blank' title=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">lighthouse</a> scores are strong. Performance is only dinged because the programming quotes cause a slight content shift. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too big a deal. Accessibility on the other hand, I will circle back and fix what&#39;s missing.</p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/53q1fsgRQVyMLi7dUXgb\" alt=\"lighthouse.png\" title=\"lighthouse.png\" width=\"697\" height=\"249\" /><p>I&#39;ll have to remember to do a more detailed writeup of my overall experience but my initial thoughts are very positive.</p><p></p><h3>Update: June 11th, 2021</h3><p></p><p>So the performance hit was actually due to Google Fonts causing the content shift. I switched them out for native font-families (Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif &amp;&amp; Georgia, serif) and now my performance score is 100%.
